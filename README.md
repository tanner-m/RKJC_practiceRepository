# CS-537_Spring-2015
CS-537 This repository is for git and gitHub practice.

Do what you want here. Try things out that you are unsure about.

Make mistakes (you can always tell people that you made the mistake on purpose just to test the system).

Learn how to fix mistakes.

If you are uncertain about something practice it here instead of on the project repository.
